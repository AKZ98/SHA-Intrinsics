# SHA-Intrinsics

This GitHub repository contains source code for SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256 and SHA-512 compress function using Intel SHA and ARMv8 SHA intrinsics, and Power8 built-ins. The source files should be portable across toolchains which support the Intel and ARMv8 SHA extensions.

Only the SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256 and SHA-512 compression functions are provided. The functions operate on full blocks. Users must set initial state, and users must pad the last block. The small sample program included with each source file does both on an empty message.

## Intel SHA

To compile the x86 sources on an Intel machine, be sure your CFLAGS include `-msse4 -msha`.

The x86 source files are based on code from Intel, and code by Sean Gulley for the miTLS project. You can find the miTLS GitHub at http://github.com/mitls.

If you want to test the programs but don't have a capable machine on hand, then you can use the Intel Software Development Emulator. You can find it at http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-software-development-emulator.

## ARM SHA

To compile the ARM sources on an ARMv8 machine, be sure your CFLAGS include `-march=armv8-a+crc+crypto`. Apple iOS CFLAGS should include `-arch arm64` and a system root like `-isysroot  /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneOS8.2.sdk`.

The ARM source files are based on code from ARM, and code by Johannes Schneiders, Skip Hovsmith and Barry O'Rourke for the mbedTLS project. You can find the mbedTLS GitHub at http://github.com/ARMmbed/mbedtls. Prior to ARM's implementation, Critical Blue provided the source code and pull request at http://github.com/CriticalBlue/mbedtls.

If you want to test the programs but don't have a capable machine on hand, then you can use the ARM  Fixed Virtual Platforms. You can find it at https://developer.arm.com/products/system-design/fixed-virtual-platforms.

## Power8 SHA

The Power8 source files are just about complete. Perforance increases significantly, but there's still room for improvement. One of the problems we are having is IBM's documentation sucks. Namely, there is none. We kind of knew that going into things because we experienced the same problems when implementaing AES on Power8.

We found some problems with the code generated by GCC 4.8.5, GCC 7.2.0 and IBM XL C/C++ 13.1. We are not aware of a workaround for the extra xxswapd and being generated by the compilers. Also see [Issue 84753 - GCC does not fold xxswapd followed by vperm](http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=84753). We tried to use inline assembly to correct it but the assembler is giving us trouble. Also see [PowerPC vec_xl_be replacement using inline assembly](https://stackoverflow.com/q/49215090/608639). We also believe the 84753 issue is reponsible for an unexpected permute for 64-bit little-endian platforms.

Below are the numbers we are onserving for SHA-256 and SHA-512. The numbers are not that impressive. Even OpenSSL's numbers are relatively dull. We expect Power8's SHA-256 to be somewhere between 2 to 8 cpb but it is only a guess.

# Benchmarks

The speedups can be tricky to measure, but concrete numbers are availble from Jack Lloyd's Botan. The relative speedups using a three second benchmark under the command `./botan speed --msec=3000 SHA-1 SHA-224 SHA-256` are as follows. The measurements were taken from a Intel Celeron J3455, and an ARMv8 LeMaker HiKey.

## Intel SHA

The following tests were run on a machine with a Celeron J3455 at 1.5 GHz (burst at 2.2 GHz). The machine has an ASUS J3455M-E motherboard, which was one of the first Goldmont's available.
